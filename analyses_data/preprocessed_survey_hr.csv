It gives me happiness when I am able to provide a job to a deserving person which in turn will act as the source of bread-butter earning. 

2. It gives a proud feeling to work with Collabera, a company which is the market leader and a trend-setter in the staffing industry. 

3. One always wants that the company he/she is working, should value its employees. Collabera stands to this statement. I as a Collabera employee has witnessed this during the COVID pandemic. The company announced that no lay-off would be done, no salary deductions would be made. This gives a happy feeling and satisfaction that I am associated with a firm which not only says but proves by actions when it comes to valuing employees. 

4. The open and always charged work culture, with nearly same age-groups working with you, the energy that one can feel in the company campus is something which you won't find in other companies. I have my many friends working in spreaded IT companies and while discussing with them, I feel that they all are lacking the atmosphere which Collabera has in its offices. ","1. Working with Collabera somewhat hampers the social life. I feel that there is no social life after the working hours, it might be due to the night working shift because of which the majority of the daytime is spent in sleeping. 
The same thing happens on weekend too.

2. I personally feel that until now, people in India relate a night job to ""Call Center/BPO"" only, and this makes a task of explaining what our job is about, a bit tough. 

3. I won't say it as a downside but when works with Collabera, the open ground and the opportunities that he/she gets while working in Collabera vanishes when you switch to any other competitor company. In any other company you feel tied to some rope. This shows the working environment that Collabera provides. 

","It was during July end of 2019 when heavy rains lashed Vadodara. Complete city was flooded within hours. Me and my manager too were among many who were stranded in the city, far from home, away from office. Some who managed to reach the office were working to keep the business going. 

Me and my manager were stuck in the flooded water till midnight, after which we somehow managed to our home. 
For the next 3 days, due to continuous rains, we were locked in our homes. Employees were not able to reach our office. During that time, many managers and senior leadership of Collabera was on the ground working like hell to carry employees to the office. They were running their cars continuously picking up employees from their locations and bringing them to the office. 

This showed the company's culture of valuing its employees. The company would have easily deducted the salary of those employees who failed to make it to the office in those floods. But Collabera lived to make the culture a truth and not just a saying. 
********************************

The second experience is from the lockdown that was imposed from Mar - May during the COVID situation. Majority of the Collabera employees are not local to Vadodara and announcement of a sudden lockdown created panic among the people. Everything was closed, whether it be rations, medical, logistics! 
Although the Indian corporate world was gradually shifting to the WFH culture at that time but as Collabera never did a WFH ever so we weren't sure about it. 

But sensing the situation, company shifted to WFH within 2 days. The complete Vadodara management was on toes to implement WFH without any problem. 

Not stopping at this, Collabera also came as a savior for those who were not local to Vadodara and were facing severe food related problems as all the shops, public canteens, supermarkets, ration supply was closed. 
During that time, Collabera arranged for a regular meal service for the interested employees. The company also provided facility for any needed ration supplies. 

Also, the company announced that the job security would be taken care of. This announcement sparked a feeling of trust and safety among the employees during those very dark unprecedented times.

There is a lot of interaction involved with Onshore-Offshore teams that not only helps to build bridges for more efficient delivery but also makes people culturally aware. 

Collabera as a brand has a very good reputation as compared to many other staffing firms. It's in the top 20 staffing firms list in the US. So, this definitely adds value to me as a recruiter and helps me build a rapport with my candidates faster. 

The values that Collabera follows are very progressive and it will make sense to anyone who believes in evolving and growing. Not just surviving. 

There are training programs not just to make you a better recruiter but also a better person by fine-tuning your abilities to interact, approach, decide & react to situations that you can easily relate to in your daily life. 

They have daily/weekly/monthly shoutouts and RnR meetings to celebrate and discuss success stories. So no good work goes unnoticed. This keeps people pumped all round the calendar. Attractive goodies will also be showered upon you if you perform exceptionally well. 

At Collabera everyone is on a first-name basis - STRICTLY. While its a professional thing that every other firm will agree to be following but that's not true. But in Collabera this is actually practiced and no one gets offended if you do not address them as Sir/Maam.

10 hours shift (50 hours weekly) is too much. You work 7-8 hours and rest 2-3 hrs you just wait to pass. For someone who is very fast and does the work in 7 hrs that someone else needs 10 hours to complete, it becomes very frustrating to wait a couple of hours just to clock your daily shift hours. 

Promotions only after you complete 2 years in the company. In extremely rare cases you get an early promotion. I personally haven't witnessed any rare cases yet. 

If the region you are hired for has slow-moving clients or new clients then you are doomed. You will find yourself in various performance enhancement plans leading to terminations within 1 year.

So doesn't matter what process/direct client, the region you work for, what your cost to the company is, the target is the same. ","Collabera never stops, sleeps, or backs out. It has a fighting spirit and no matter what the size of trouble it, Collabera always moves forward. The DNA that Collabera has makes it operate at optimal efficiency all the time.

3. Trips & picnics : Collabera takes its employees who win E3 contest on trips and picnics twice a year, winning that is a dream for many departments.","Again indian perpective
1. Overworked : all the employees are overworked and overburdened, there is no such thing as over time, many employees regularly stay beyond normal working hours sometimes as much as 12-15 hours, without getting paid OT, I guess US employees are lucky in that regard.
2 Low Wages : Collabera is not a good paymaster, when it comes to salaries. The amount of work done is inversely proportional to salaries received. Employees would appreciate if collabera gave higher than average salaries for once.
3. Holidays : getting sick days and holidays approved is a hassle, we do not get holidays on indian festivals, but we also do not get holidays on ALL American holidays.

One thing i like about Collabera is that they have Good Incentives, Competitions, Awards for all of their employees which is Open for all specially the Presidents club. The ofc setup and environment is good to work. ","Hard work sometimes goes unnoticed due to favoritism or dislike towards a person and promotion gets hampered. No proper communication among sr. managers and the HR team specially when it comes to any issues or promotions. No proper road map provided for promotions.  No proper resolution or attention to such issues at all from.  One more Con would be that you can be a winner in such competitions only if you have a good running accounts, which otherwise no matter how hard you try, you will not overcome it. So again these competitions would be fruitful to limited set of audience and not to those supporting low sided business. This point of awards I am presenting from every persons perspective and not just my point.","One of the best experiences so far with Collabera is the PC awards. They give the best experience of a lifetime in such events by having trips. 2nd is the Blaze awards. These are some of the best things about Collabera which I admire. One of the negative experience is that when it comes to promotion cycles there is no proper roadmap and promotion is only measured based on numbers achieved irrespective of slow accounts given by managers. Effort level is not considered. I believe its really unfair as when a person is given a slow moving accounts and then expect high numbers and still donot give them the promotions even after working on those for 2 years stating numbers are not inline. Team size is also cut down, seniors are moved out due to slow accounts and then the expectation is to build a backup of yourself when the team consists only of 1-2 years old recruiters. HR does not have much say or take any action here. Favoritism is at the peak in some teams. Have experience this not once but twice during my tenure.

1) Collabera culture - You can't find better environment to start your career.

Due to subjectivity associated there are individuals who are either over burned with extensive work load OR there are individuals who find easy excuse route to shrug work load on others. Lack of objective evaluation of each resource develops complacency in system. Organization allows descent learning time which is positive aspect however promoting mediocrity is not fair. e.g resource is allowed to work in specific department without core skills for that department / job. (Training are also provided to such individuals which is positive aspect but again application of trained aspects in job role are not evaluated objectively.

Almost instantly, I respond back saying I am calling him. She is a new team member and I knew the team lead had to go on a sudden emergency due to a family emergency and her manager was on a planned leave. She was following the standard escalation procedure and reaching out to me. Wasn't quite sure about the criticality but wanted to address whatever was brewing up as soon as possible.

As I login the bridge and she starts explaining the situation saying she tried to reach others, dropped them a message and then called me. She comes to the issue at hand and this is when I understand while the task at hand is not something that's handled by our team anymore, in the past we did handle that and as I was trying to look through my notes, I realized someone joining the bridge.

To my surprise, I see her manager joining the call and surprised I ask, how come she is joining and here comes the response - ""I checked my messages and realized there's an issue at hand and know that lead had to leave all of a sudden"", The next thing I hear is that I should leave since she (Manager) is in the call and she should be able to drive things and ping me if necessary.

As I send a smiley and about to exit, I hear another ping and this time it's the lead. This time both lead and manager kind or pass a surprised message at each other asking how come they joined when they were not supposed to be there.

At this time, I kind of burst out in laughter and say, practically I was the only one supposed to be there but with two powerful ladies around, I must drop off.

If given an opportunity to work as per the areas of interests, I feel that people would want to stay for a longer period. Again, the pay grade is really less, people tend to leave after gaining expertise from Collabera. Instead if they’re paid enough they can take Collabera to the next level but because of lower pay grade, they’ll learn from Collabera and utilize and implement their expertise somewhere else.",4.0,5.0,3.5,2.81,Senior Account Executive,Enterprise Services Group,Sales,Sales,Vadodara (CH2),Gujarat,India,Collabera Services Private Limited,1992,Male,Asian,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,https://stanfordgsb.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_38dr9nHMwN9McUR?Q_DL=54948zKMDgUkF11_38dr9nHMwN9McUR_MLRP_8pP78cr4e1f2geh&Q_CHL=gl,1,Asian,,

Lot of arguments, logical/illogical but Mehul always forgave me. Rahul always there to guide me. Himanshu does understands my strength/weakness and knows how to get work done from me. CP is my Nemesis. Kapil one of the smart guy, who is my role model. Title does not motivate me but people does and these are few people who make a strong reason to work with Collabera.
- Collabera was there when I met with almost fatal road accident.
- People are treated as people by Collabera.
- Ample opportunity is given to new joiners to perform. 
- This is second recession that I am seeing with Collabera and we did not lay people off, at least in Baroda.
- It’s been 14 years, still feels like day one, however miss big time working with Mehul, Rahul and CP. 
- Sham, Hemin, HireMe...the down to earth people, for whom would do anything.
- I can go on, Collabera is the best place to work with.
","'- If someone wants to resign, we make it too difficult for that person, not saying we should not try to save, but it gets too much.
-Feel a lot that,I am a slave to U.S. counter parts especially NAMs. They don't understand people challenges here in Baroda, have to obey them. Was thrown out of client coz of chemistry mismatch.
- I have clients who are a big time challenge to cater, but that is not taken into consideration during ratings and/or money. 
- I have overshot stretch target, but was paid for stretch money, when target missed was very less or nothing.
- We are or entering or entered in saturation phase, opportunities are drying up. ","'- Responsive beyond Imagination - CP even managing the day, he responds to my email even at middle of night(India). Rahul always responds to me in few hours.
- Play hard Work hard - CPL, CVPL, Navratri, Diwali, Christmas...biggest of all Blaze are true example of how we play hard. Got a bulk deal on Friday and people were there to work on Saturday to support it.

Advice to Management

Management should call to employee and resolve the issue of employee regarding issues.","Overall company is good when it comes to professionalism. Though in some teams, default politics is there due to accidental managers! But there are some professional / true managers too.

Culture is good. Salary, benefits, increments and incentives are way too low. Most of too good people leave them only because of salary and rest who are still below average need security, so they are unable to leave!

Also, in this Covid-19 phase, we are observing so much pressure from upper management. We have been assigned with multiple tasks that we can't dedicate our complete focus only on the recruiting part as these other tasks have been added in the KRA.

Difference in the standards that Sales and Delivery are being held to. Pressure is too much on the Recruiters/Delivery than the sales. 
Delivery has too many parameters that they are being hold accountable for and failing in any one of them leads to taking a hit on the commission - on the same hand, sales have it very easy for them, even if they fail to meet their numbers, their commissions are not being hit.
Off-Shore/OnShore Mentality
Toned down commission plan for foreign workers.

There is a lot of potential for growth - professionally, financially and personally and that is the best thing that I love and am internally grateful for - this company has offered us the sky with no limit :) ","as much as a work life balance is encouraged - it honestly is not. the fact that those who show success are working at least 50 hours a week and we only get the standard paid holidays  + the few days of PTO  is really discouraging. i feel like if this company recognized employees' hard work and grit by allowing more mental health days or PTO days then it would feel a little more worth it to put in the over time hours. each individual office is so completely different and has it's own culture in itself that it is even hard to comment on the culture of this company as a whole since it doesn't seem like overall as a whole corporate cares about the employees. sometimes it feels like we are just a number expected to bring in money and that every one is replaceable. sometimes it feels like there is not a whole lot of communication from corporate to each individual office - i feel like i am just working for one particular office rather than the whole company, which in a sense is true but i definitely do not feel like i belong to a company bigger than just my office. the health and wellness of employees especially during Covid/quarantine has not even been addressed - there are so many companies that have granted a few personal days here and there for the entire company to take a step back and mentally refresh from all that's going on in the world right now. even our clients have been given a Friday off here or there to take a mental day, educate themselves on what is going on in the world, debrief from the stressors and truly just take time for themselves. i have heard across the board that the hours we have been working from home are so much longer than the ""standard hours"" - there are days when myself and my coworkers are working until 9 or 10 at night just to wake up in a few hours to do it all over again in the same room. obviously i know you see the success from what you put into it, but sometimes it would be nice to hear from the employer that it is okay and actually encouraged every once in a while to take a step back and pause to refresh your mind body and soul so you can hit the ground running even harder after your break. we aren't given enough time off each year to take these breaks especially during the holidays when we want to spend it with our loved ones. I feel like I have to be very mindful and scarce of the time I am taking off to ensure I have time saved up throughout the year if I am sick or there is a family emergency - this wouldn't even let me live a life outside of work either. I have to be strategic and save up some time to roll over to the next year to allow myself that extra cushion in case there is an emergency or something comes up and I have to use it - we don't even have leave for bereavement. 

As much as I love this company and working for this company - it can get very overwhelming in the sense of a work/life balance not being fully respected or recognized by corporate as a whole. We don't live to work, we work to live and that needs to be celebrated and recognized so it makes it feel like our hard work and many hours spent overtime is worth it! 

Sometimes I feel like the burnout comes from the culture of the company coming across as very transaction driven rather than relational driven and it also shows from the benefits our own employees receive. ","For being ""the largest minority owned company"" - it doesn't feel like it recognizes minorities. For example, during the BLM, it took quite some time for it to even be addressed and honestly as a company that employs people of all shapes, sizes and colors, it should have been addressed right away, educational resources should have been sent out, resources to talk about it with HR should have been sent out - there was a very surfaced level statement made by 1 person in this entire company and as a person of color myself, it truly didn't not seem like there was a whole lot of support given to the employees. It was so unbelievably difficult for me to wake up on that Monday morning after the passing of George Floyd and to call my clients and even talk to them about business. In the grand scheme of things, closing deals and bringing in reqs was not relevant at the time and even my close clients agreed with that so it was very hard to ask how people were doing and then to jump into a discussion about business - it was tone deaf to not even recognize what was going on and to act like it was just another day at the office. Of course, I know the world keeps on turning but sometimes when the whole world is paused and truly hurting like it has been in 2020 on an international level, there needed to be some encouragement or support to to just take a few steps back and breathe. Our company culture just pushes for numbers and transactions that we get so wrapped up in it all, we can sometimes come across as tone deaf to what is happening around us. We are a people serving business and I know that our culture should be represented each individual employee in their own way but overall our company's is saying else.

","I love Collabera, I really do, but here is an example of the internal battles we are constantly fighting. 
We bring in a service opportunity. We sell the opportunity through several client interactions at the regional level (with the help of our regional ITSS contact, of course). We have a final presentation call set up with the client, and on the day of the call, I start getting mtg fwd notifications. suddenly 4 additional collabera people from across the country who all have NOTHING to do with this deal are accepting the invite. People are arbitrarily looping other people in on our business. I then had to spend an hour calling around and explaining why we cannot just have our entire team on a call with clients who don't know them. That is not how sales works. Everyone wants to be involved in things that don't involve them. And they want to take credit for things that they had nothing to do with. It's messy and sloppy, and does not make us look very professional. I have had several of the same experience since then. I have also dealt with some petty internal ""I should be the only recruiter allowed to work on this"" nonsense. Not at all helpful for the ""good of the group"" mentality that we should all have. unfortunately fighting these internal political nuances takes up valuable time.

As Collabera is a Recruiting & Staffing Organization, Compare to Sales & Delivery, No Strong growth & Incentive plans for GBS departments like Audit, Finance, IT. While these are most important departments and key growth driving teams. There is a lot of improvement need to be done for these teams in terms of an individual's financial growth as well as learning opportunities. 

2. There is a lot of gap between leaders & their managers. Leaders especially Team Leads/Mid-level leadership are being shadowed in many teams by managers being it by performance appraisals or recognition and shadowing their ability and visibility to higher management. Due to this, many talented & knowledgable leaders have not to be recognized which leads to an average rating of them. They are not able to perform with their full potential in spite of they are ready to take bigger roles. Managers Skip Level roles for leads will fully showcase their capability to higher management and then they should be benefited by promotions because employees in Lead roles are working with stakeholders at ground level & actually execute all the important projects with planning.   

3. There are very less flexibility benefits for Indian employees compare to US counterparts which create partiality experience for leaders between both the region. A couple of examples are different in policy for Work From Home, Flexi Benefits, different working hours, Less focus on People Health Policy, Limited Medical benefits compare to other Indian companies. These areas should be improvised   

4. Less Focused Financial Growth Plans for GBS People: Lack of Transparency in Performance Appraisals cycles. Goals defining vs Actual Roles/Responsibility performed. ","Positive:
United Youth & Celebrations Together of each and every event & festival makes entire Collabera connected with everyone. People are helping each other strongly.
